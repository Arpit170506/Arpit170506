# Hey, I’m [Arpit Mishra] 👋

Web dev who vibes with C++ and Python, debugging with flair.  
Fueled by plot twists, syntax quirks, and just the right amount of caffeine.  
Currently building cool stuff, one repo at a time.

---

### 🛠️ Tech I Tinker With  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and sometimes they even listen)
- Python 🐍, C++ 🚀  
- Dipping toes into Solana, Solidity & smart contracts

---

### 🎯 Current Quests 
- Slowly turning side projects into portfolio gold

---

### 📚 When Not Coding  
You’ll find me in a plot twist—whether it’s on a page or on a screen.  
Sci-fi, thrillers, or anything with a well-written villain.
